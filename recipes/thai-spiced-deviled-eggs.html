        <p>Thai-spiced Deviled Eggs masquerade as portly pumpkins.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Eggs</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons thick coconut milk, cold(not low fat) or mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon ketchup</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon paprika plus more to sprinkle</li>
            <li>¼ Teaspoon Sriracha or other red chilli sauce</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the eggs with an inch of cold water and bring to a boil. Boil for a minute, then cover and set aside for 10 minutes. Drain and then fill the pan with cold water. After 5 minutes, peel the eggs. Slice each egg length-wise and gently remove the yolks.</li>
            <li>Place the yolks and all the other ingredients in a small bowl and mash until very smooth. Mound the yolk mixture into the egg whites or transfer it to a ziptop bag and pipe it out. Wet your finger and pat the surface of the filling smooth. Using a toothpick draw lines to make the 'pumpkin' indentations. Sprinkle with paprika if desired. Cut up the green part of the onion to make tiny stems and add them to finish off the pumpkin look.</li>
        </ol>
